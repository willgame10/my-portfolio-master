    <p id="meparagraph">Hello! my name is William Howell. I am currently in my 4th year of college learning to become a software engineer. At first I came
        to college wanting to become a psychology major. I found out one semester in that it wasn't what I wanted to do. I wasn't going make something out
        of myself with good looks so leaving college wasn't a choice. So I chose to become a software engineer. At first I was very new to the whole world of coding
        because I never thought this is what I would want to do earlier in life but after my first classes I found it a lot of fun. I really enjoyed programming and
        being able to create and control what happens on the screen. Just writing code alone was an enjoyment, all the times I was frustrated all overlooked
        because of that sweet feeling of finishing what you had to code or fix. I really love this major and can't wait to see how I continue to grow through the years.
