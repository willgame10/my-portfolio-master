<h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Hello! my name is William Howell. I am currently in my 4th year of college learning to become a
    software engineer. At first I came
    to college wanting to become a psychology major. I found out one semester in that it wasn't what I wanted to do. I
    wasn't going make something out
    of myself with good looks so leaving college wasn't a choice. So I chose to become a software engineer. At first I
    was very new to the whole world of coding
    because I never thought this is what I would want to do earlier in life but after my first classes I found it a lot
    of fun. I really enjoyed programming and
    being able to create and control what happens on the screen. Just writing code alone is an enjoyment, all the times
    I've been frustrated all overlooked
    because of that sweet feeling of finishing what you had to code or fix.
    <br>
    Currently I haven't created anything worth value but I have a whole bunch of projects I have worked on in classes.
    Each of these projects is a little bit of knowledge
    that I learned and all show me growing. From learning html/css to learning C++ and Java. I have files with code of
    each of these languages and there is soon to be more.
    The next type of code I am taking on is javafx and creating a GUI with a database. This is probably the cooler of
    the other files because it is bringing together most
    of what I understand and putting it in one while learning new stuff like using databases and SQL.
    <br>
    Other than my homework the previous experience with engineering projects I have is exclusively with Neuro-Tech. I am
    working with a few others to create GUI and we hope to do more than just this.
    I can't really write about most of it but it is really cool to see how we are connecting hardware with software to
    create something. I hope my journey with them continues although it is rough to keep up with
    classes and work all together. I really love software engineering and can't wait to continue learning about all the
    new technology and how to code many different languages. My path on what I will end up working on
    in software engineering isn't clear but I will say that I want to be working with breakthrough tech. Like tech for
    VR or tech using brain signals as input and I can 100% see myself doing this in the near future.
