        <p>This is a file containing assembly code to produce a light flash signaling SOS I worked on in CDA 3104</p>

        <p>This is a paper I wrote for my COP class in which I describe the differences between these three majors and
            why I chose the Major I'm currently in.</p>

        <p>this is my scratch profile. On here you can find two games that I created using scratch.</p>

    <li><a href="Health%20and%20Technology.pptx" target="_blank">a slide show writing about current efforts on global
        challenges.</a>
        <p>
            In this assignment I talk about two types of technology in the health topic of global challenges. The first
            one is a bionic that is a prosthetic arm
            that sends messages back to the user through the nerves to imitates the sense of touch.
            <br>
            The second technology includes nanobots.
            For this part I talk about a few products being researched like nanobots that can seek and destroy cancer to
            pills that you can swallow and will administer medicines while monitoring
            health.
            <br>
            From this project I learned that there are a lot of things to think about when you want to create something
            like
            documentation on what a product is and that once you create something like the sense of touch you might be
            able to apply one
            creation to many others.

    <li><a href="Hamilton%20University.pdf" target="_blank">a poster of a future solution for facial recognition
        with bank transactions.</a>
        <p>
            In this assignment we made groups with a few peers with similar interests, Mine was cyber security. We had
            theorized
            about a product that would make bank transactions safer.
            we saw an opportunity to appeal to bankers and investors who would like more security. We thought first off
            that banks
            need to be secure to have any business and investors
            alike need a place to secure all of their cash. So why don't we make it secure from people who might be
            monitoring your computer at home like a keylogger.
            <br>
            To do this we thought we could do facial recognition and throw on 2FA to make it extra secure. This would
            make your account super personalized because no transaction will be made unless you are on the camera. This
            would be a good idea in today's society considering a lot of people already have cameras at home on
            computers for
            remote work.
            <br>
            I personally think the project was fun to do and a nice break from coding to just think about something
            futuristic and working with my group mate was enjoyable as well.
