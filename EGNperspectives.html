<h1 class="header">My EGN experience</h1>
<p id="paragraph">My experience with EGN has been very interesting. I felt like a lot of the work I did was busy work.
    Although said I did not take the work as a joke.
    I understood why the class is important and its mainly to help us get into the mindset of what a software engineer
    should be thinking about and how he should
    go about solving solutions to problems. I learned that when programming there are ethics to take into account and
    when creating technology I want to
    be the person to produce something that will bring good and not destruction. I want to create something that will
    help humans and do what I can to make sci-fi
    reality but safely and with the correct procedures. We also payed a lot of attention to topics like global warming
    and things that affects everyone on the globe.
    These were things I never thought about and when we talked about it in class I enjoyed learning about it because in
    reality I don't think I would have done research
    like this otherwise. I had a great time with the course as well because I like thinking about all the possibility's.
    If I could go back and retake this class I would
    do so only to research and focus on other topics. Although nothing is preventing me from doing my own research.</p>

        challenges.</a>
        <p id="inDark">
            In this assignment I talk about two types of technology in the health topic of global challenges. The first
            one is a bionic that is a prosthetic arm
            that sends messages back to the user through the nerves to imitates the sense of touch.
            <br>
            The second technology includes nanobots.
            For this part I talk about a few product being researched like nanobots that can seek and destroy cancer to
            pills that you can swallow and will administer medicines while monitoring
            health.</p>
