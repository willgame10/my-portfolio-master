<h1 class="header">My EGN Perspectives experience and projects</h1>
<p id="paragraph">My experience with EGN has been very interesting. I felt like a lot of the work I did was busy work.
    Although that's how the class felt I treated it like any other class.
    I understood why the class is important and its mainly to help us get into the mindset of what a software engineer
    should be thinking about and how he should
    go about solving solutions to problems. I learned that when programming there are ethics to take into account and
    when creating technology I want to
    be the person to produce something that will bring good and not destruction. I want to create something that will
    help humans and do what I can to make sci-fi
    reality but safely and with the correct procedures. We also payed a lot of attention to topics like global warming
    and things that affect everyone on the globe.
    These were things I never thought about and when we talked about it in class I enjoyed learning about it. Something
    that I never really payed much attention too
    was global warming and health in other countries. These are big things that I now pay attention too with a lens on
    it.
    before I was never the person to care about
    global warming or what's happening in uganda but now I can be the person to help solve issues like this and the
    first
    step was just researching a little about a big problem.

    <li><a href="Health%20and%20Technology.pptx" target="_blank">a slide show writing about current efforts on global
        challenges.</a>
        <p class="inDark">
            In this assignment I talk about two types of technology in the health topic of global challenges. The first
            one is a bionic that is a prosthetic arm
            that sends messages back to the user through the nerves to imitates the sense of touch.
            <br>
            The second technology includes nanobots.
            For this part I talk about a few products being researched like nanobots that can seek and destroy cancer to
            pills that you can swallow and will administer medicines while monitoring
            health.
            <br>
            From this project I learned that there are a lot of things to think about when you want to create something
            like
            documentation on what a product is and that once you create something like the sense of touch you might be
            able to apply one
            creation to many others.

    <li><a href="Hamilton%20University.pdf" target="_blank">a poster of a future solution for facial recognition
        with bank transactions.</a>
        <p class="inDark">
            In this assignment we made groups with a few peers with similar interests, Mine was cyber security. We had
            theorized
            about a product that would make bank transactions safer.
            we saw an opportunity to appeal to bankers and investors who would like more security. We thought first off
            that banks
            need to be secure to have any business and investors
            alike need a place to secure all of their cash. So why don't we make it secure from people who might be
            monitoring your computer at home like a keylogger.
            <br>
            To do this we thought we could do facial recognition and throw on 2FA to make it extra secure. This would
            make your account super personalized because no transaction will be made unless you are on the camera. This
            would be a good idea in today's society considering a lot of people already have cameras at home on
            computers for
            remote work.
            <br>
            I personally think the project was fun to do and a nice break from coding to just think about something
            futuristic and working with my group mate was enjoyable as well.
